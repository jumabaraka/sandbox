⚠️  failed to check fix bare-mdx-stories-glob

Error: ❌ Unable to determine Storybook stories globs in [object Object], skipping bare-mdx-stories-glob fix.

In Storybook 7, we have deprecated defining stories in MDX files, and consequently have changed the suffix to simply .mdx.

We were unable to automatically migrate your 'stories' config to include any .mdx file instead of just .stories.mdx.
We suggest you make this change manually.
